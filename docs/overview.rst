Getting Started
===============
The default way to create a visualization with this module consists of 2 steps:

1. create multiple :doc:`Distributions <distribution>` out of data and join them into an array

2. :doc:`Plot <img_possibilities>` the distributions and view the data.

.. note::

    To get an even better understanding check the :doc:`examples <example_data>` out.
